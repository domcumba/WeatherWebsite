# WeatherWebsite
Making a small website to help me learn more skills relating to web development. Right now I am focusing on learning more about the Bootstrap 4 framework and making a responsive mobile-friendly website.

## How I'm Building It
I'm using HTMl, CSS, and Javascript so far as well as using the Bootstrap 4 framework

### Latest Change (8/29/2019)
My latest change has been working with the card container to nicely format my output for when the user requests weather data. I also made the card collapse just because I thought it looked cool, however I'm not sure if I will keep this change forever. 
I added more weather data such as a description of the weather and the temperature of the city the user types in. I'm just trying to figure out how to add the units that the temperature is measured in.
